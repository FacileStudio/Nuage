// Package oidcavatar reads the profile claims Authentik returns at login.
//
// It used to download the picture and keep a copy under STORAGE_DIR. It no longer does:
// the URL Authentik hands over is public, cacheable and served by Porte, so the local copy
// was a cache of something we are not the source of — one that a container rebuild quietly
// emptied while the database went on pointing at it. Keeping the URL instead removes the
// copy and the SSRF surface that fetching an attacker-influenced URL from inside our own
// network opened.

// PhotoURL returns the picture claim when it is a photo somebody actually chose, and ""
// when it is not.
//
// The distinction is the whole reason this function exists. Authentik never omits the
// claim: a user with no photo gets `data:image/svg+xml;base64,…`, its own drawing of their
// initials. Testing `picture != ""` — which every app in the suite did — therefore reads
// "has an avatar" as always true, which is why an upload could never serve as the fallback
// and why the old fetch failed its own HTTPS check every five minutes in silence.
//
// An https URL is a file in Porte's media store. Anything else is a placeholder we can
// draw better ourselves, so it is reported as no photo at all.
